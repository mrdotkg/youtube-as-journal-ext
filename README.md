YouTube for Blog Readers transforms your YouTube browsing into a thoughtful, text-focused experience ideal for blog readers:

- **Hides distracting thumbnails** across all YouTube pages (home, channel, playlist, search, watch page sidebar)
- **Shows video durations prominently** by extracting duration from thumbnails and displaying it beside titles
- **Hides channel avatars** for a cleaner, text-focused interface
- **Shows full video titles** without truncation for better content understanding
- **Preserves essential info** like creator names, view counts, upload dates
- **Configurable page-specific settings** - disable on specific YouTube pages as needed

Transform YouTube from a visual-temptation platform into a text-focused, blog-like content discovery tool - perfect for readers who prefer content over clickbait imagery.
