## âœ¨ What it does

YouTube As Journal transforms your YouTube browsing into a thoughtful, journal-like experience:

- **Hides distracting thumbnails** across all YouTube pages (home, channel, playlist, search, watch page sidebar)
- **Shows video durations prominently** by extracting duration from thumbnails and displaying it beside titles
- **Preserves essential info** like creator names, view counts, upload dates
- **Configurable page-specific settings** - disable on specific YouTube pages as needed
- **Coming soon**: Full video titles without truncation and channel avatar hiding options

Transform YouTube from a visual-temptation platform into a text-focused, journal-like content discovery tool - perfect for mindful browsing and focusing on content quality over clickbait.
